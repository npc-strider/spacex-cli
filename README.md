`npm install -g npc-strider/spacex-cli`

This is an enhanced version of a basic CLI bash script I was using.

Because the bash script was based on the v3 [spacexdata](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) api, I was forced to upgrade it to use the new v4 api. 

So I decided to not just upgrade the bash script to use the new api, but also add some new features and more interactibility. 

The cli isn't pretty like some others, but I think it's quite dense in relevant information.
